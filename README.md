# Machine Learning A to Z
A collection of awesome beginners-friendly machine learning tutorials and projects. 
### Data Analysis
> Data analysis is a process of inspecting, cleansing, transforming, and
modeling data with the goal of discovering useful information, informing
conclusions, and supporting decision-making. - [Data Analysis, Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_analysis)

### Data Science
> Data science is a multi-disciplinary field that uses scientific methods,
processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and insights from
structured and unstructured data. - [Data Science, Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science)

### Machine Learning
> Machine learning (ML) is the scientific study of algorithms and statistical
models that computer systems use in order to perform a specific task
effectively without using explicit instructions, relying on patterns and
inference instead. - [Machine Learning, Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning)

### Artificial Intelligence
> Colloquially, the term "artificial intelligence" is used to describe
machines/computers that mimic "cognitive" functions that humans
associate with other human minds, such as "learning" and "problem
solving". - [Artificial Intelligence, Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence)

Think of AI as a destination and machine learning as one path to get there. AI
research and development aims to mimic human cognitive functions, including
decision making. Machine learning is the most promising attempt toward AI to date.

### Deep Learning
> Deep learning (also known as deep structured learning or hierarchical
learning) is part of a broader family of machine learning methods based on
artificial neural networks. - [Deep Learning, Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning)

Deep learning refers to a family of ML methods that deal with neural networks.
Neural networks usually need much more data to train than other ML methods.
Deep learning offers exceptional performance in some, but not all domains. It
shines in domains like computer vision, natural language processing, and audio
processing.

## Key machine learning terms and concepts
Machine learning terms can be confusing. Here are definitions of key terms to help you.

- **Data exploration** is the process of gathering information about a large and often unstructured data set in order to find characteristics for focused analysis. 
- **Data mining** refers to automated data exploration. 

- **Descriptive analytics** is the process of analyzing a data set in order to summarize what happened. The vast majority of business analytics - such as sales reports, web metrics, and social networks analysis - are descriptive. 

- **Predictive analytics** is the process of building models from historical or current data in order to forecast future outcomes. 

### Supervised and unsupervised learning 

- **Supervised learning algorithms** are trained with labeled data - in other words, data comprised of examples of the answers wanted. For instance, a model that identifies fraudulent credit card use would be trained from a data set with labeled data points of known fraudulent and valid charges. Most machine learning is supervised. 

- **Unsupervised learning** is used on data with no labels, and the goal is to find relationships in the data. For instance, you might want to find groupings of customer demographics with similar buying habits. 


### Other common machine learning terms
- **algorithm:** A self-contained set of rules used to solve problems through data
processing, math, or automated reasoning.
- **anomaly detection:** A model that flags unusual events or values and helps you
discover problems. For example, credit card fraud detection looks for unusual
purchases.
- **categorical data:** Data that is organized by categories and that can be divided
into groups. For example a categorical data set for autos could specify year,
make, model, and price.
- **classification:** A model for organizing data points into categories based on a
data set for which category groupings are already known.
- **feature engineering:** The process of extracting or selecting features related to
a data set in order to enhance the data set and improve outcomes. For instance,
airfare data could be enhanced by days of the week and holidays. See Feature
selection and engineering in Azure Machine Learning.
- **module:** A functional part in a Machine Learning Studio model, such as the
Enter Data module that enables entering and editing small data sets. An
algorithm is also a type of module in Machine Learning Studio.
- **model:** A supervised learning model is the product of a machine learning
experiment comprised of training data, an algorithm module, and functional
modules.
- **numerical data:** Data that has meaning as measurements (continuous data) or
counts (discrete data). Also referred to as quantitative data.
- **partition:** The method by which you divide data into samples.
- **prediction:** A prediction is a forecast of a value or values from a machine
learning model.
- **Regression:** A model for predicting a value based on independent variables,
such as predicting the price of a car based on its year and make.
- **score:** A predicted value generated from a trained classification or regression
model.
- **sample:** A part of a data set intended to be representative of the whole.
Samples can be selected randomly or based on specific features of the data set.
