## Some Data Analytics Term and Definition
- data analysis:The process of inspecting, cleaning, transforming and modeling data for business decision-making.
- data analyst:A person whose job is to examine information in order to find something out or to help with making decisions.
- data type:A classification that determines the possible values for the type and the way the values can be stored.
- record:A set of fields in a database related to one entity.
- common concatenation:Creating a single field for first and last name.
- syntax:The spelling and grammar of a programming language.
- join clause:Combines records from two or more tables in a relational database.
- workflow diagram:Depicts a series of actions that define a job or how work should be done. A workflow diagram visualizes how tasks will flow between resources, whether theyâ€™re machines or people, and what conditions allow the sequence to move forward.
- data governance:Defined process an organization follows to ensure high-quality data exists throughout the complete lifecycle.
- data dictionary:Maps and defines data, and oftentimes shows the relationship.

### Data Analysis
> Data analysis is a process of inspecting, cleansing, transforming, and
modeling data with the goal of discovering useful information, informing
conclusions, and supporting decision-making. - [Data Analysis, Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_analysis)

### Data Science
> Data science is a multi-disciplinary field that uses scientific methods,
processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and insights from
structured and unstructured data. - [Data Science, Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science)

### Machine Learning
> Machine learning (ML) is the scientific study of algorithms and statistical
models that computer systems use in order to perform a specific task
effectively without using explicit instructions, relying on patterns and
inference instead. - [Machine Learning, Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning)

### Artificial Intelligence
> Colloquially, the term "artificial intelligence" is used to describe
machines/computers that mimic "cognitive" functions that humans
associate with other human minds, such as "learning" and "problem
solving". - [Artificial Intelligence, Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence)

Think of AI as a destination and machine learning as one path to get there. AI
research and development aims to mimic human cognitive functions, including
decision making. Machine learning is the most promising attempt toward AI to date.

### Deep Learning
> Deep learning (also known as deep structured learning or hierarchical
learning) is part of a broader family of machine learning methods based on
artificial neural networks. - [Deep Learning, Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning)

Deep learning refers to a family of ML methods that deal with neural networks.
Neural networks usually need much more data to train than other ML methods.
Deep learning offers exceptional performance in some, but not all domains. It
shines in domains like computer vision, natural language processing, and audio
processing.
