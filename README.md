## Some Data Analytics Term and Definition
- data analysis:The process of inspecting, cleaning, transforming and modeling data for business decision-making.
- data analyst:A person whose job is to examine information in order to find something out or to help with making decisions.
- data type:A classification that determines the possible values for the type and the way the values can be stored.
- record:A set of fields in a database related to one entity.
- common concatenation:Creating a single field for first and last name.
- syntax:The spelling and grammar of a programming language.
- join clause:Combines records from two or more tables in a relational database.
- workflow diagram:Depicts a series of actions that define a job or how work should be done. A workflow diagram visualizes how tasks will flow between resources, whether theyâ€™re machines or people, and what conditions allow the sequence to move forward.
- data governance:Defined process an organization follows to ensure high-quality data exists throughout the complete lifecycle.
- data dictionary:Maps and defines data, and oftentimes shows the relationship.
