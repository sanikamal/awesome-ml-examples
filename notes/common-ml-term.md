# Common Machine Learning Terms
- **algorithm:** A self-contained set of rules used to solve problems through data
processing, math, or automated reasoning.
- **anomaly detection:** A model that flags unusual events or values and helps you
discover problems. For example, credit card fraud detection looks for unusual
purchases.
- **categorical data:** Data that is organized by categories and that can be divided
into groups. For example a categorical data set for autos could specify year,
make, model, and price.
- **classification:** A model for organizing data points into categories based on a
data set for which category groupings are already known.
- **feature engineering:** The process of extracting or selecting features related to
a data set in order to enhance the data set and improve outcomes. For instance,
airfare data could be enhanced by days of the week and holidays. See Feature
selection and engineering in Azure Machine Learning.
- **module:** A functional part in a Machine Learning Studio model, such as the
Enter Data module that enables entering and editing small data sets. An
algorithm is also a type of module in Machine Learning Studio.
- **model:** A supervised learning model is the product of a machine learning
experiment comprised of training data, an algorithm module, and functional
modules.
- **numerical data:** Data that has meaning as measurements (continuous data) or
counts (discrete data). Also referred to as quantitative data.
- **partition:** The method by which you divide data into samples.
- **prediction:** A prediction is a forecast of a value or values from a machine
learning model.
- **Regression:** A model for predicting a value based on independent variables,
such as predicting the price of a car based on its year and make.
- **score:** A predicted value generated from a trained classification or regression
model.
- **sample:** A part of a data set intended to be representative of the whole.
Samples can be selected randomly or based on specific features of the data set.
