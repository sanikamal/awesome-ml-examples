# Analyzing Netflix Data

> ### Apply the foundational and Intermediate Python skills to `manipulating` and `visualizing` movie and TV data!

## Project Description

In this project, apply the skills learned in `Introduction to Python` and `Intermediate Python` to solve a real-world data science problem.
Press `watch next episode` to discover if Netflix’s movies are getting shorter over time, using everything from lists and loops to pandas and matplotlib.
Gain experience in an essential data science skill — `exploratory data analysis`. 
This allow to perform critical tasks such as manipulating raw data and drawing conclusions from plots created of the data.
