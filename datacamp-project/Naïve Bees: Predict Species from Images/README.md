# NaÃ¯ve Bees: Predict Species from Images
> Build a model that can automatically detect honey bees and bumble bees in images.

## Project Description

Can a machine distinguish between a honey bee and a bumble bee? 
Being able to identify bee species from images, while challenging, would allow researchers to more quickly and effectively collect field data. 
In this project, you will use the Python image library Pillow to load and manipulate image data, then build a model to identify honey bees and bumble bees
given an image of these insects.


## Project Tasks

    1. Import Python libraries
    2. Display image of each bee type
    3. Image manipulation with rgb2grey
    4. Histogram of oriented gradients
    5. Create image features and flatten into a single row
    6. Loop over images to preprocess
    7. Scale feature matrix + PCA
    8. Split into train and test sets
    9. Train model
    10. Score model
    11. ROC curve + AUC
